# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

So far we have created an initial application that has rspec included instead of the default Test::Unit framework.
